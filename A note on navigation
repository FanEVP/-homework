Folders are named after the lesson number. However, "10" (the folder) is the tenth Turing lesson we had, or lesson 20 overall.

Questions from the lesson docs are labelled using uppercase letters (ex. #1 in the doc would be A, #2 would be B, and so on)
Questions from Touque are labelled using numbers
Variations/subquestions are labelled using lowercase letters or numbers (depending on some criteria that I don't understand anymore)
and they come after the uppercase letter or number
